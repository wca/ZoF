# DESCRIPTION:
# Test that injected decompression errors are handled correctly.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create an compressed dataset with a test file
# 2. Inject decompression errors on the file 20% of the time
# 3. Read the file to confirm that errors are handled correctly
# 4. Confirm that the decompression injection was added to the ZED logs
#
